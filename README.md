# mine-sweeper
A game of minesweeper created by me, with a little help of ideas

##The game
Just pick a size of the map you wanna play and how many bombs ( if 0 bombs is picked it will automatically make 14% of them bombs )

##Change stuff
You can change the size of each cell by changing squireSize.

##For this work
you will need it to reference to a p5.js and jquery CDN or downloaded folder of these 2!
Jquery version is 3.3.1
